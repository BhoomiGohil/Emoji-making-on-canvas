# Emoji Making on Canvas

This repository demonstrates how to create emojis dynamically on an HTML5 canvas using JavaScript. It is a fun project that showcases the use of canvas for rendering shapes and expressions programmatically.

## Features

- Dynamic creation of emojis with varying expressions.
- Use of the HTML5 canvas for custom drawings.
- Modular and reusable JavaScript code for generating shapes and features like eyes, mouth, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is recommended.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhoomiGohil/Emoji-making-on-canvas.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Emoji-making-on-canvas
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the canvas.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
2. Modify the JavaScript file to customize emoji features such as shapes, colors, and expressions.
3. Reload the browser to see the updated emojis.

## Code Explanation

### Core Logic

- **Canvas Setup**: The HTML5 `<canvas>` element is used as the drawing area.
- **Emoji Components**: JavaScript functions handle the rendering of emoji components like:
  - **Face**: Drawn as a circle with a fill color.
  - **Eyes**: Small circles positioned dynamically.
  - **Mouth**: A combination of arcs or lines to depict different expressions.
